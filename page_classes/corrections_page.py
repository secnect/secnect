        ### What's Coming

        The Named Entity Recognition module will include:

        - **Entity Extraction**: Automatically identify users, IP addresses, hostnames
        - **Pattern Recognition**: Detect common attack patterns and behaviors  
        - **Timeline Analysis**: Create timelines of security events
        - **Relationship Mapping**: Show connections between entities
        - **Custom Models**: Train models on your specific log formats

        ### Stay Tuned

        We're actively developing this feature. Check back soon for updates!

            **What entity types would be most valuable for your use case?**
            - User accounts and roles
            - Network addresses and ports
